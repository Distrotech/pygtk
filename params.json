At present, it is a complete set of bindings up to and including\r\nthe gtk+-2.24 API.\r\n\r\nIf you have any enhancements or bug reports, please file them in\r\nbugzilla at:\r\n  http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=pygtk\r\n\r\nIf you have a patch, file the bug first and then use the \"create new\r\nattachment\" link on the bug's info page.  My preferred format for\r\npatches is unified diff format (ie. diff -u).  Please don't send me\r\ndiffs which don't have any context, as these make it very difficult to\r\nsee what the patch does.\r\n\r\nNew Versions\r\n============\r\n\r\nNew versions of this package can be found at:\r\n  http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/pygtk/\r\n\r\n\r\nMailing list\r\n============\r\n\r\nThere is a mailing list for pygtk.  You can subscribe to it through\r\nthe web interface:\r\n  http://www.daa.com.au/mailman/listinfo/pygtk\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n============\r\n  * C compiler (GCC, MSVC and mingw supported)\r\n  * Python 2.3.5 or higher\r\n  * PyGObject 2.21.3 or higher\r\n  * Pycairo 1.0.2 or higher\r\n  * Glib 2.8.0 or higher\r\n  * GTK+ 2.8.0 or higher (optional) or\r\n    GTK+ 2.10.0 or higher for 2.10 API\r\n    GTK+ 2.12.0 or higher for 2.12 API\r\n    GTK+ 2.14.0 or higher for 2.14 API\r\n    GTK+ 2.16.0 or higher for 2.16 API\r\n    GTK+ 2.18.0 or higher for 2.18 API\r\n    GTK+ 2.20.0 or higher for 2.20 API\r\n    GTK+ 2.22.0 or higher for 2.22 API\r\n    GTK+ 2.24.0 or higher for 2.24 API\r\n  * libglade 2.5.0 or higher (optional)\r\n  * pycairo 1.0.2 or higher (optional)\r\n  * numpy (optional)\r\n\r\nThis release is supporting the following GTK+ releases:\r\n\r\n  2.8.x\r\n  2.10.x\r\n  2.12.x\r\n  2.14.x\r\n  2.16.x\r\n  2.18.x\r\n  2.20.x\r\n  2.22.x\r\n  2.24.x\r\n\r\nTo include support for the 2.10 API you'll need GTK+ 2.10.0 etc.\r\n\r\nCopyright Information\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nThis software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public Licence\r\n(version 2.1, or if you choose, a later version).  Basically just don't\r\nsay you wrote bits you didn't.\r\n\r\nCompilation\r\n===========\r\n\r\nPyGTK uses the standard autotools for the build infrastructure.  To\r\nbuild, it should be as simple as running:\r\n\r\n    $ ./configure --prefix=<prefix where python is installed>\r\n    $ make\r\n    $ make install\r\n\r\nTo build the reference documentation, supply the argument\r\n\"--enable-docs\" to configure.\r\n\r\nIf your Python interpreter isn't in the path, or is not called\r\n\"python\", you can set the PYTHON environment variable to the full path\r\nof the interpreter:\r\n\r\n    $ PYTHON=/prefix/bin/python\r\n    $ export PYTHON\r\n\r\nIf configure can't find GTK+, you may need to set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH\r\nenvironment variable to help it find the libraries.\r\n\r\nThe \"make install\" target will generate normal and optimised bytecode\r\nfor all the .py files.\r\n\r\nNote. If you're installing to another prefix than the one where python\r\nis installed you'll need to set the PYTHONPATH variable to the\r\n$prefix/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages directory created by\r\nthe PyGTK installation.\r\n\r\nTests\r\n=====\r\n\r\nAfter having compiled and installed pygtk, you may want to test them.\r\nThere are a number of example programs available in the examples/\r\nsubdirectory.\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting Help\r\n============\r\n\r\nIf you have questions about programming with PyGTK, you might want to\r\nsend a message to the mailing list (information on subscribing is\r\nabove).  Alternatively, your question may be answered in the FAQ:\r\n\r\n    http://www.async.com.br/faq/pygtk/?req=index\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
